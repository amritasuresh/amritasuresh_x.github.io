# <img src="pictures/picture3.png" style="float: left;" alt="drawing" width="300"/> Amrita Suresh
I am a first year PhD student at the [LSV](https://www.lsv.fr), ENS Paris Saclay, under the supervision of [Alain Finkel](http://www.lsv.fr/~finkel) and [Benedikt Bollig](http://www.lsv.fr/~bollig).
My research is currently mainly focused on formal verification of infinite state systems, more specifically FIFO systems. I am studying underapproximations of the general model in hopes for finding expressive yet decidable subclasses. I really enjoy automata theory, logic, and the intersection of these topics with computational complexity.
